DevForce.io - Task

Hello, this is a task to test your React Native skills. In this test, we will evaluate the following abilities:

1. Create a React Native app
2. Create an interface using an existing framework or use your own imagination
3. Connect to a GraphQL public API
4. Upload images and photos (you can upload anywhere you like)
5. Document the project with instructions to build and run it on simulator (Android and iOS)

The public API is available at https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

The app I want has the following workflow:

1. Home screen

    - Shows a list of characters
    - When a character is selected, it shows the character details


2. Character details screen

    - Shows the character details
    - Shows a list of episodes

    - Possibility to upload the character image

    - When an episode is selected, it shows the episode details

    - Back button goes back to the home screen

3. Episode details screen

    - Shows the episode details
    - Shows a list of characters

    - Possibility to upload the episode image

    - Back button goes back to Character Details and home button goes back to the home screen

You can send me a zip file with the project or a link to the repository.

Good luck!
